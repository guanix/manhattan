Manhattan Electronics for RepRap
================================

This design is inspired by [Melzi](http://reprap.org/wiki/Melzi) with a stepper module design from [4pi](https://github.com/kliment/reup) based on the Allegro A4982 stepper driver. It will use an Atmel AT90USB1286 microcontroller with built-in USB support.

It is designed in KiCad to avoid the board size limitations of the free edition of EAGLE.
