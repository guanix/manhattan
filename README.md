Manhattan Electronics for RepRap
================================

This design is inspired by [Melzi](http://reprap.org/wiki/Melzi) with a stepper module design inspired by [4pi](https://github.com/kliment/reup).

*Status*: This is very much a work in progress. The schematic is done and I am currently working on footprints.

Features
--------

* Atmel AT90USB1286 microcontroller with built-in USB serial support
* Allegro A4982 stepper driver in TSSOP package
* Digital potentiometer for current control, avoiding expensive and annoying trimpots
* Designed in [KiCad](http://kicad.sourceforge.net/), an open source EDA suite
